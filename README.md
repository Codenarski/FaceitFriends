## About The Project

This is a chrome extension where you can track your friends elo on faceit.com. For this, you just have to install the extension and add your friends nicknames. 
Using the faceit api, the elo will be determined for the nickname specified.
With the update button, a new request is triggered aswell as everytime when opening the extension.
